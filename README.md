# BSC-SMART-CA w/Functions
"This is a Binance Smart Chain (BSC) smart contract designed for a customizable token with built-in tax functionality and trading control. The contract includes a tax mechanism that automatically deducts a configurable percentage from each transaction, which can be directed to a designated wallet (e.g., for development, marketing, or liquidity). Additionally, it features an enable/disable trading function, allowing the contract owner to toggle trading on or off, providing flexibility to manage token circulation or prevent unauthorized trading during specific phases (e.g., presale or launch). The contract is equipped with ownership controls, ensuring the deployer retains authority over key parameters, such as adjusting the tax rate, updating wallets, or toggling trading status, all while maintaining transparency and security on the BSC network."
